UI Tech Test
============

### Task requirements

Please:
* Create an HTML page to represent the search results design in the `jet-search.png` image. Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.
* We have provided the sketch version of this design for those of you who have this software (you can get a [30-day free trial](https://www.sketch.com/try/) on Mac).  We have also tried to automatically convert this file to PSD for those who have access to Photoshop.
* Style the page so that it looks like the design.  This can be done in CSS, SCSS, LESS – whatever you prefer.
* Write a small piece of JavaScript so that the 'Search for a restaurant' search box shows and hides the restaurants displayed on the page.
* Use the icons and images in the `/assets` folder to help you when styling the page.


## Important considerations

* We don’t expect candidates to finish all of the styling detailed in the design (as we appreciate that would take a lot of time).  Focus on making the parts that you do work on a good standard that reflects your ability.  We’d rather see a number of the components from the design styled well, than lots of incomplete components.
* We don’t expect your submitted code to work in all browsers (given the time constraints), but showing that you’ve thought about fallbacks when using newer language features is expected.
* Think about how the CSS you write can be used across other pages on the site.  We build our CSS in a component-driven way so show us that you can do that too.
* If you want to use a grid framework to help you out with the base layout, that’s completely fine.  Please don’t use a framework to do the majority of your styling though – we want to see an example of your own CSS, not that you can use a CSS framework.
* We understand that you may be developing from a PNG and not the Sketch or Photoshop file – don’t get too hung up on exact colours of text or margins between elements. We'll be looking at the structure of your code more than expecting pixel precision.
* Don’t overcomplicate the JavaScript part of the task.  We just want to see that you know how to write basic JS.
* We advise spending at least an hour or two on the test – if you want to spend more or less time on it, that’s completely up to you.


# Technical Questions

* What approaches did you use when completing the test?  Do you use any CSS methodologies or techniques to help this approach?
* If you had more time to spend on the test, what would you like to add to your solution?
* What browsers should your test work in?  What will happen if we test it in older browsers like IE10?
* What's your favourite programming language? Why?
* Please describe yourself using JSON.

Please submit your code as specified by the recruiter. Usually this will be via Google Drive.

Thanks for your time – we look forward to hearing from you!
