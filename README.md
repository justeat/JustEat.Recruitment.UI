UI Tech Test
============

### Task requirements

Please:
* Create an HTML page to represent the search results design in the `JE-search.png` image. Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.
* Style the page so that it looks like the design.  This can be done in CSS, SCSS, LESS – whatever you prefer.
* Write a small piece of JavaScript so that the 'Find by restaurant name' search box shows and hides the restaurants displayed on the page.
* Use the icons and images in the `/assets` folder to help you when styling the page.


## Important considerations

* We don’t expect candidates to finish all of the styling detailed in the design (although you’ll get mega kudos if you manage to!).  Focus on making the parts that you do work on a good standard that reflects your ability.  We’d rather see a number of the components from the design styled well, than lots of incomplete components.
* Your test should be usable in as many browsers as possible.  This doesn’t mean that it needs to look exactly the same, but it shouldn’t look completely broken either.  For example, if you choose to use Flexbox, we expect to see some sort of fallback provided (using modernizr to help with this is fine).
* Think about how the CSS you write can be used across other pages on the site.  We build our CSS in a component-driven way so show us that you can do that too.
* If you want to use a grid framework to help you out with the base layout, that’s completely fine.  Please don’t use a framework to do the majority of your styling though – we want to see an example of your own CSS, not that you can use a CSS framework.
* We understand you’re developing from a PNG and not a Sketch or Photoshop file – don’t get too hung up on exact colours of text or margins between elements.
* Don’t overcomplicate the JavaScript part of the task.  We just want to see that you know how to write basic JS.
* We advise spending at least an hour on the test – if you want to spend more or less time on it, that’s completely up to you.


# Questions

* What approaches did you use when completing the test?  Do you use any CSS methodologies or techniques to help this approach?
* If you had more time to spend on the test, what would you like to add to your solution?
* What browsers should your test work in?  What will happen if we test it in older browsers like IE8/9/10?
* What's your favourite programming language? Why?
